# The Argon Roguelike Engine
A reimplementation of the neon roguelike engine for the .Net environment.

## Structure
The engine is split up in four different projects:
- the `server`, a C# console project
- the `client`, using SkiaSharp for 2D rendering
- the `editor`, an Uno Platform project
- a `common` class library containing all shared code
